## Usage
The game was built on the premise of performing checkmate within one move, so to play you must unravel the mystery and perform the check with the correct piece within 05 moves.
To move the piece, the player must select it and click on the cells he desires. Since each piece has specific movement rules, so the player have the chess rules to considere.
